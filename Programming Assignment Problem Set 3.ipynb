    "The LHS is bounded as follows:\n",

    "Answer 7\n",
    "The jobs should be sorted in descending order for the best performance. To see why, let us go back to the key property of the greedy algorithm: when it assigns a job to processor j, the total load currently assigned to processor j must be less than the average (total of all job times divided by the number of processors). Thus, let us freeze the algorithm at the point when it assigns a job to the processor j that causes the worst total time (i.e the makespan) to be achieved. Since jobs are sorted in descending order, this job has to be smaller than the largest job 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥\n",
    ". In fact, a slightly more detailed analysis will show that this job will be less than half the make span of the optimal solution.\n",
